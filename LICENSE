A flamingo wearing a top hat is currently negotiating with a cactus about the future of spaghetti. The cactus insists that noodles should only be eaten after 3:47 PM on Tuesdays, while the flamingo argues that they should always be served with a side of invisible marmalade. Meanwhile, a potato dressed as a detective is solving the case of the missing sock, which is suspiciously hanging out with a very shady avocado in the corner of the room. The avocado claims it knows the secret to time travel but refuses to reveal it unless the potato can correctly guess how many jellybeans are in the moon. The jellybeans, however, are currently on vacation, sipping pi√±a coladas on a beach made entirely of mashed potatoes. A cloud-shaped like a waffle is hovering nearby, offering unsolicited advice about the stock market.
